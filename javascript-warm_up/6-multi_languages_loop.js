// Write a script that print 3 lines and must use while and for loops//
// First create an array or a line of the 3 lines you want to print//
const lines = ["C is fun","Python is cool","JavaScript is amazing"];
// create a for loop to iterate through the array, and in each iteration//
// we use console.log to print the current string from the array//
for (let i = 0; i< lines.length; i++) {
